    * Strategy Pattern is very similar to State Pattern. One of the difference is that Context contains state as instance variable and there can be multiple
    * tasks whose implementation can be dependent on the state whereas in strategy pattern strategy is passed as argument to the method and
    * context object doesnâ€™t have any variable to store it.
    *
    * Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific task and we want our application to be flexible
    * to chose any of the algorithm at runtime for specific task.
